## Project Overview

The **Call Compliance Analyzer** processes customer service call recordings to provide comprehensive insights through:

- **üîä Transcription**: Converting audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper model
- **‚úÖ Compliance Checks**: Detecting required greetings, closings, and disclaimers
- **üîí Sensitive Information Detection**: Identifying and masking PII and profanity
- **üòä Sentiment Analysis**: Determining conversation tone and emotional context
- **üè∑Ô∏è Call Categorization**: Classifying calls into meaningful business categories
- **‚è±Ô∏è Diarization**: Measure customer-to-agent speaking ratio (agent should not dominate), detect excessive agent interruptions, and track time-to-first-token (TTFT) for agent responses.

Built with **FastAPI** for the backend, **Loguru** for logging, and **mkdocs-material** for documentation.
