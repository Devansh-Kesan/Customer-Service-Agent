## üåü What Worked Well

- **Centralized Logging**: Using Loguru with ZMQ for unified logging improved debugging
- **Modular Design**: Breaking the project into smaller components enhanced maintainability
- **FastAPI**: Provided excellent performance and ease of use for API development

## üß© Challenges

- **Transcription Accuracy**: Whisper occasionally struggled with low-quality audio or accents
- **PII Detection**: Balancing false positives and negatives in PII detection was challenging
- **Log Rotation**: Configuring log rotation and compression required careful setup
- **Logging and Debugging**: Initially, debugging errors was challenging due to insufficient logging. Adding detailed logs helped identify issues like mismatched transcript formats and improved the overall robustness of the tool.

## üí° What I Learned

- **Modular design**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller functions made the codebase easier to maintain and debug.
- **Logging Best Practices**: Effective use of Loguru for centralized logging and management
- **API Design**: Improved skills in designing intuitive RESTful APIs with FastAPI
- **Error Handling**: Better approaches to exception handling and error messaging

## üîç Project Difficulty

Overall, the project was **moderately challenging**. Integrating multiple libraries (e.g., Whisper, PyAnnote, Hugging Face Transformers) and ensuring compatibility between them required careful planning and testing. However, the effort paid off as the final tool is robust and provides valuable insights into customer-agent interactions, including compliance markers, sentiment analysis, and speaking behavior metrics.
